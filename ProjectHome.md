This is a project we (Me and Mart√≠n Rassia) did for a class we're taking in our university, Universidad Nacional de Rosario in Argentina.

So far the project is very basic, this is what we needed to pass the class. It captures the buttons and 4 lines from the fpga at 230400 bps, and shows it in an PyGTK GUI.
